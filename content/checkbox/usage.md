Checkboxes are used to select none, one or more options from a list or to enable/disable specific settings. Each checkbox operates independently of others.

They are commonly found in data tables for row selection, filter interfaces, and settings forms where users need to toggle features on or off.

Unlike switches, checkboxes typically require user confirmation to take effect. When users check or uncheck a checkbox, the change is usually applied only after they perform an action such as clicking a "Save" or "Apply" button. In contrast, switches provide immediate feedback and apply changes instantly without requiring additional confirmation.

### In data tables

In data tables, include a checkbox in the header row to control all row selections. This header checkbox should display different states based on the current selection:

*   **Child-selected state:** When some, but not all, table rows are selected
*   **Checked state:** Only when all rows in the table are selected
*   **Unchecked state:** When no rows are selected

### When to use

*   Selecting multiple items from a list or table
*   Enabling or disabling features (e.g. in a form)
*   When requiring user acknowledgment of something (e.g. accepting TOS)
*   Filtering content where changes should be applied deliberately
*   The selection state needs to be confirmed before taking effect

### When not to use

*   Only one option can be selected (use radio buttons instead)
*   The change should take immediate effect (use a switch instead)
*   The action is destructive or has immediate consequences
